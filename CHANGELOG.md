## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- New `showEmptyOptGroups` option (default `true`) controls whether empty `<optgroup>` headers (groups with no `<option>` children) appear in the dropdown. When `true`, the header is always shown; when `false`, the optgroup is omitted entirely.

### Fixed

- Empty `<optgroup>` headers no longer disappear after the first time the dropdown is opened. Previously the post-close filter reset would mark groups with no visible children as hidden, so an empty optgroup was visible on first open but hidden on every subsequent open until the page reloaded.

---

## [1.3.6] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- The checkbox tick in multi-select dropdowns no longer follows `--ks-color-option-hover-text` on hover. Previously the inner `<path stroke="currentColor">` inherited the option row's `color`, so setting a hover text colour (e.g. white) made the tick disappear against the pale checkbox background. The checkbox now sets its own `color`, anchored to a new `--ks-color-checkbox-tick` variable, so the tick stays readable regardless of option text colour.

### Added

- New `--ks-color-checkbox-tick` CSS custom property controls the colour of the checkmark glyph inside multi-select checkboxes (and the dash glyph used for the indeterminate state on per-group "Select all" rows). Defaults to `var(--ks-color-option-selected-fg)` so existing rendering is unchanged; set it explicitly to give the tick a distinct colour.

---

## [1.3.5] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Hovering a selected row in the dropdown now applies the hover background (`--ks-color-option-hover`) as well as the hover text colour (`--ks-color-option-hover-text`), instead of keeping the selected-row background while only changing the text. Hover styling is consistent across selected and non-selected rows. Themes that set `--ks-color-option-selected-row` to a colour distinct from `--ks-color-option-hover` will see selected rows take the hover colour while hovered, then return to the selected colour when the pointer moves away.

---

## [1.3.4] — 2026-05-19

### Added

- New `--ks-color-option-hover-text` CSS custom property controls the text colour of dropdown rows on hover and keyboard focus. Undeclared by default so existing rendering is unchanged (the underlying selected-row text colours still apply on hover); set it in a theme and the chosen colour wins in every state — single, multi, selected, unselected.

---

## [1.3.3] — 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- Restored the multi-mode indigo text tint on selected rows in the dropdown. The previous `.ks-multiple .ks-option.ks-option-selected` rule was a no-op because the dropdown (and mobile overlay) are appended to `<body>`, and `.ks-multiple` was only set on the wrapper — so the descendant selector never reached the option. The dropdown and mobile overlay now also carry `.ks-single` / `.ks-multiple`, matching the wrapper, and the rule reaches them as intended.

### Changed

- `--ks-color-option-selected-row-text` is no longer declared on `:root`. Its default is now provided via `var()` fallback at each use site: `inherit` in single mode, `var(--ks-color-option-selected-fg)` in multi mode. Setting the variable in a theme still overrides both modes. (This makes multi-mode's restored indigo default themable by a single variable, rather than forcing themers to also override `.ks-multiple .ks-option.ks-option-selected` directly.)

---

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- New `--ks-color-option-selected-row-text` CSS custom property controls the text colour of selected options in the dropdown. Defaults to `inherit` (so the text colour matches surrounding option text as before); set it explicitly to give selected rows a distinct text colour.

---

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- New `--ks-color-option-selected-row` CSS custom property controls the row-background colour of selected options in the dropdown, independently of the hover/keyboard-focus colour (`--ks-color-option-hover`). Defaults to `var(--ks-color-option-hover)` so existing themes are unchanged; set it explicitly to give selected rows a distinct colour.

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-16

### Changed

- **`allowHtml` now defaults to `false`** (previously `true`). Tag characters in option text are shown literally by default, which is safer when option content may come from user input or other untrusted sources. **Migration:** if you were relying on the previous default to render markup, pass `allowHtml: true` explicitly when initialising — only do so when the option text is trusted.

### Fixed

- Global "Select all" and per-optgroup "Select all" now operate only on the currently visible (filter-matching) options when a search query is active. Previously they would silently toggle hidden options too. The checked / indeterminate visual state of each select-all row also tracks the visible scope while a filter is in effect.
- Search now matches only against option text. Previously a query that matched an optgroup's label would reveal *all* of that group's options regardless of their own text. Optgroups still appear in results — but only when at least one of their child options matches.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- `class` and `style` attributes on the source `<option>` and `<optgroup>` are now propagated onto the rendered chrome — option `<li>`s, group `<li>`/header/options-list, and selected-state tags (multi) / single-value span (single). Lets consumers attach per-row styling hooks (e.g. `style="--chip-color: #b53f5c"` for DB-derived colours, or `class="is-recommended"` for enumerable states) directly on the source select markup and have them surface on the widget. Classes are appended to the framework's own classes (`ks-option`, `ks-tag`, etc.) rather than replacing them, so existing styling continues to work unchanged.
- `summarizeSelected: false` is now accepted as an alias for `'off'` — useful for callers that prefer a boolean disable.

### Changed

- (none)

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added

- Summarize Selected feature - shows "{n} selected" instead of the individual selections, and can be configured. Default is set to `auto` (which shows "{n} selected" if the selected items list would wrap to a second line.

### Added

- `autoSync` option (default `true`) — the widget now watches the underlying `<select>` for external mutations (options added/removed, attribute changes, label edits, programmatic `value` assignment followed by a `change` event) and stays in sync automatically. Manual `refresh()` and `kselect:sync` calls are no longer required for these cases. Set `autoSync: false` to opt out.
- All events dispatched by kselect (`change`, `kselect:change`, `kselect:open`, `kselect:close`) now carry an `event.kselect === true` flag so listeners can distinguish kselect-originated events from external mutations of the underlying `<select>`.

### Changed

- Selected options in the dropdown now carry the same row-background highlight used for hover, in both single- and multi-select modes. Previously single-mode selection was a loud solid-indigo / white-text pill, and multi-mode selection had no row background at all (only a tinted text colour) making selected items hard to spot at a glance.

### Fixed

- Dropdown now resizes to match the control when the wrapper's width changes while open (e.g. selected-tag pills pushing the control wider in a flex/grid layout).
- Active search filter is preserved across `refresh()` and `kselect:sync` so the visible-option list no longer resets when a host framework triggers a rebuild mid-search.
